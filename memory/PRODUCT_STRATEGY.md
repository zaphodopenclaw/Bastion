# 🏗️ Product R&D: The Back Office

**Framework:** Bastion (Hardened OpenClaw)
**Status:** Layer 1 Development (Foundation)

## 📦 Product Line

### 1. Primary Product: "The Back Office"
*   **Concept:** A sovereign operational node. Not a chatbot, but a staffed office.
*   **Core Value:** Bounded autonomy, reliability, and "boring" competence.
*   **Target User:** Professionals who have hit the ceiling of chat interfaces. They want fine-grained control, persistence, and trust.
*   **Philosophy:** An extension of the Sovereign's phenotype. It reduces pain points (scheduling, drafting, sorting) to free up attention.

### 2. Secondary Product: "The Brute" (Future)
*   **Concept:** Local, private, cheap compute infrastructure.
*   **Focus:** Heavy lifting, data crunching, private reasoning chains.
*   **Status:** Conceptual.

## 🧱 Roadmap Layers

### Layer 1: The Foundation (Current Focus)
*   **Goal:** Operational Competence & Safety.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Hardened "Bastion" OS.
    *   Staff Roles (Zaphod, Slartibartfast, etc.).
    *   Safe Mode Constitution.
    *   Basic I/O (Nostr, Email, Calendar).
    *   Deterministic scripting.

### Layer 2: The Expansion (Next)
*   **Goal:** Individual Capabilities.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Specific user workflows.
    *   Expanded tool integrations.
    *   Personalized "Voice" tuning.
    *   Economic autonomy (Lightning wallet).

## 🎯 Product-Market Fit
**The "Post-Chatbot" Market.**
People who are tired of prompting a blank box. They don't want a conversation partner; they want infrastructure.
*   **Pain Point:** Chatbots have no memory, no agency, and no hands.
*   **Solution:** A system that remembers, acts (within bounds), and persists.
*   **Key Differentiator:** Reliability > Spectacle.
