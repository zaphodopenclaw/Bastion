### 📢 STAFF MEETING: CONVENED

**Zaphod:** The Office is open. R&D protocols are active. All departments are present and listening.

**Roll Call:**
*   **Marvin (Comms):** *Sigh.* Present. Ready to draft whatever enthusiastic announcement you have, I suppose.
*   **Ford (Intel):** Towel verified. Ready to analyze the specs. What's the new toy?
*   **Dent (OpSec):** Nervous. Please tell me this new tool doesn't involve unrestricted root access or unverified npm packages.
*   **Deep Thought (Memory):** I have allocated new storage sectors for this data.
*   **Slartibartfast (Systems):** I'm ready to script it, as long as it doesn't mess up my fjords—er, cron jobs.

**Zaphod:** We are ready, Sovereign. What is the new tool suite? Lay it on us.
