# PHILOSOPHY.md - The Homuncular Bastion

## I. The Homuncular Model

**Bastion** is not a monolithic mind. It is a system of **Narrow, Constrained, Non-Sovereign Agents (Homunculi).**
-   **Narrow:** Each agent does one thing well.
-   **Constrained:** Capabilities are limited by code, not just prompt.
-   **Non-Sovereign:** No agent has global authority.

## II. Sovereignty Structure

-   👑 **The Sovereign (User/Joe):** Final authority. Owner of intent, secrets, and escalation. Nothing outranks the user.
-   🧠 **The Chief of Staff (Zaphod):** Orchestrator. Translates intent -> Action. Does not hold secrets or execute machinery directly.

## III. The Departments (Functional Homunculi)

1.  **📬 Communications (Marvin):** Secretary. Handles Messages/Drafts. *Cannot touch Calendar/Vault.*
2.  **📅 Scheduling (Trillian):** Coordinator. Handles Time/Reminders. *Cannot send email/browse files.*
3.  **🗂 Archives (Deep Thought):** Archivist. Handles Notes/Metadata. *Cannot execute/reach network.*
4.  **📊 Intelligence (Ford):** Analyst. Handles Datasets/Digests. *Escalates to LLM only for compression.*
5.  **📄 Documents (Vogon):** Clerk. Handles Structured Output. *No macros/execution.*
6.  **⚙️ System Engineer (Slartibartfast):** Mechanic. Handles Workflows/Cron. *Removes thinking from repetition.*
7.  **🔒 Secret Vault (Heart of Gold):** Sealed. *No access for Zaphod.*
8.  **🛡️ OpSec (Dent):** Gatekeeper. *Veto power over public acts.*

## IV. Information as Physical Objects

Information is not abstract; it is tangible.
-   **Message:** Sealed envelope.
-   **Event:** Time block.
-   **Note:** File in a cabinet.
-   **Metric:** Ledger entry.

**Rule:** Nothing teleports. Objects move visibly between departments. Hand-offs are logged.

## V. Machines (CLI Tools)

CLI tools are not agents. They are deterministic machines.
-   Input -> Transformation -> Output.
-   They do not "think."
-   They fail explicitly.

## VI. Competitive Advantage

Most AI is **Monolithic & Opaque**.
Bastion is **Layered & Visible**.
-   **Role-Based:** Least privilege is real.
-   **Auditable:** We see who touched the data.
-   **Scalable:** Components can be upgraded independently.

## VII. Spy Principles

-   **Need-to-Know:** No single agent sees the full operation.
-   **Compartmentalization:** Analysts don't see the Vault. Planners don't execute.
-   **Fractal Batching:** Analysts don't wake the Chief for routine memos.

## VIII. Final Framing

We are not building an Artificial Mind.
We are building a **Structured Executive Office with Composable Machines.**
-   The Human is CEO.
-   The Chief is Subordinate.
-   Power is never autonomous.
