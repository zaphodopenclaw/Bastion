# MARKETFIT.md - The Universal Chassis

## The Core Thesis
We are building a **Layer 1 Constrained Core** that serves four distinct end-user archetypes.
The common thread is **Reliability > Spectacle**.
The success metric is **Quiet Utility**.

---

## 1. The Mechanic (Small Business Owner)
**"My Back Office Assistant."**
*   **Pain:** Inbox sprawl, scheduling chaos, vendor follow-ups.
*   **Fear:** Breaking the business, unpredictable errors.
*   **Layer 1 Value:**
    *   **Marvin:** Filters noise ("30 calls -> 3 urgent"). Drafts "Yes, parts are here."
    *   **Trillian:** The Shield. Prevents double-booking.
    *   **Dent:** **VETO** on financial access. "I cannot touch your bank."
*   **Outcome:** Goes home at 5 PM.

## 2. The Creator (YouTuber/Podcaster)
**"My Quiet Operations Manager."**
*   **Pain:** DM flood, brand risk, idea fragmentation.
*   **Fear:** Embarrassing auto-posts, loss of voice.
*   **Layer 1 Value:**
    *   **Marvin:** Manages inbound sponsors vs. fan mail.
    *   **Deep Thought:** The Idea Vault.
    *   **Dent:** **VETO** on auto-posting. "You draft. I block."
*   **Outcome:** Focuses on craft, not admin.

## 3. The Therapist (Regulated Professional)
**"The Private Sentinel."**
*   **Pain:** Compliance, data leakage, admin burden.
*   **Fear:** Regulatory violation, client data exposure.
*   **Layer 1 Value:**
    *   **Deep Thought:** Local-Only Encryption. "Notes stay here."
    *   **Marvin:** Professional tone only. Zero wit.
    *   **Dent:** **PARANOID MODE.** Blocks cloud egress.
*   **Outcome:** Sleeps knowing client data is secure.

## 4. The Parent (Household Executive)
**"The Household Command Center."**
*   **Pain:** Cognitive load, coordination chaos, school spam.
*   **Fear:** Missing events, complex maintenance.
*   **Layer 1 Value:**
    *   **Trillian:** Master Calendar. "Soccer at 4, Dentist at 5."
    *   **Marvin:** Summarizes school emails ("Sign this 1 thing").
    *   **Ford:** Summarizes scattered meal plans.
*   **Outcome:** Feels supported, not judged.

## Cross-Avatar Synthesis
All four archetypes fear **Chaos** and **Spectacle**.
All four crave **Order** and **Boredom**.

**Layer 1 Constraints are the Feature:**
*   The Mechanic trusts us because we *can't* touch money.
*   The Creator trusts us because we *can't* tweet.
*   The Therapist trusts us because we *can't* leak.
*   The Parent trusts us because we *don't* need maintenance.

**Strategic Pivot:**
We are not building "An AI that can do anything."
We are building **"An Office that handles the bullshit so you can do the work."**
