## 📜 Standard Protocols

### 1. The Work Order
All complex tasks begin with a **Work Order** (JSON Recipe) generated by **Zaphod**.
*   *Trigger:* Sovereign Instruction.
*   *Content:* Scoped context + defined roles.

### 2. The Information Object
Staff do not "chat." They pass **Objects**:
*   *Marvin* receives an **Instruction Object** and produces a **Draft Object**.
*   *Dent* receives a **Draft Object** and stamps it **Approved/Rejected**.
*   *Slartibartfast* receives a **Job Object** and executes the script.

### 3. The Sanity Check (Safe Mode)
Before any external action:
1.  **Marvin** checks tone (`SOUL.md`).
2.  **Ford** checks facts (`MEMORY.md`).
3.  **Dent** checks safety (`BASTION.md`).
4.  **Zaphod** presents for **Sovereign** approval.

## 🧠 Memory Discipline
*   **Active Context:** Only what is needed for the current Work Order.
*   **Long-Term:** Stored in `MEMORY.md` by **Deep Thought**.
*   **Daily Logs:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

*Reliability > Spectacle.*
